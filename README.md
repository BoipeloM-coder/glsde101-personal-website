# glsde101-personal-website

Hello Girlcoder and welcome to your first repository to clone !
This text is displayed from the `README.md` source file at the root of the repository.

A `LICENSE` file is also attached to specify how one can distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon this source code.

If you don't want to allow copying your website, change the license with a new [one supported by Github with this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository).

## Content

The content is pretty straight-forward:

- 1 HTML page
- 1 image

### Change it into your own profile page

Copy the HTML in your personal repository at the root folder.
Copy your profile picture at the root folder too.

Open the file with your Internet browser, and reload the page each time you make a change (with F5 key or by clicking the reload button).

Modify the following code line in the `index.html` file from

```
<img src="/my-profile-picture.png" alt="Girlcoder" style="width: 100%" />
```

to

```
<img src="/me.jpg" alt="My name" style="width: 100%" />
```

and replace the file name with your own and "My name" by your own name.

Now modify the text about you as you wish:

```
      <h1>Zandile Doe</h1>
      <p class="title">Software developer</p>
      <p>Girlcode Bootcamp</p>
```

And the social links & email:

```
      <div style="margin: 24px 0">
        <a href="https://twitter.com/GirlCode_za"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a>
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/girlcodeza"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a>
        <a href="https://github.com/GirlCodeZA"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>
      </div>
      <p>
        <a href="mailto:girlcode@gmail.com"><button>Contact</button></a>
      </p>
```

Thanks to W3Schools for their [example profile card](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_profile_card.asp) from which we borrowed the code.
